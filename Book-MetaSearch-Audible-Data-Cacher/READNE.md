Book-MetaSearch-Audible-Data-Cacher
===================================

An application designed to be run as a cron-job. Will retrieve the files
released by Audible weekly, process, and store necessary information in
a local database for consumption by the Book-MetaSearch-Api.

More information will be added as service is developed.
